### StellarSTEM 

StellarSTEM was created by @brendismode, @ym1na, Yasmin Sawaf, and Hayley Nguyen for the 2024 Sparkhacks Hackathon at UIC

It is a platform inspired by our own experience as women in STEM, and the experience of women about us. Our hope is that StellarSTEM grows and becomes a powerful resource for women in STEM when looking for inspiration, role models, success stories, and events where it is guaranteed that they are welcome.
